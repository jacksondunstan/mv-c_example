MV-C Example Unity3D Project
---

MV-C is an MVC-like pattern for Unity3D. It has two parts. First is a model-view that handles input, output, and data representation. Second is a controller that uses the model-view to perform logic.

This example project is explained in depth in the [introductory Article](http://jacksondunstan.com/articles/3611) by Jackson Dunstan. It consists of a single scene with a single "enemy" that can be damaged and eventually killed by mouse clicks. Its sole purpose is to introduce the MV-C design pattern.
